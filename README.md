This game was created by Ifeoluwa Adeyosoye. 
This project was my highschool senior project. 

Goal: 
Create a Python based video game inspired by my High School's mascot (The Obezag - Gazebo backward) using Pygame library in under two weeks while creating all assets from scratch and learning Pygame library. 

Result: 
Obezag Gold Rush - an endless runner 2D video game (similar to Google's Dinosaur game) where you play as an Obezag character that jumps over volleyballs, dodges flying monster while collecting coins. 

Goal of game: 
Collect as many coins as you can while dodging obstacles.

Description of game: 
Step into the shoes of the agile Obezag character and navigate through a vibrant landscape filled with challenging obstacles. Dodge menacing volleyballs and evade terrifying flying monsters while collecting shiny coins along the way. Test your reflexes and aim for the highest score in this addictive adventure. How far can you go?

Outline of my two weeks: 
- Setting up software applications needed (Python IDE *Pycharm*, Pygame module, Photoshop, etc)
- Sketching visuals of the game/drawing out classes of objects/characters
- Creating pseudo code for the movement of characters/objects and their functions
- Digital creation of pixel characters/objects 
- Creating a menu & tutorial screen
- Begin writing the actual code for the game 
- finalize game

Asset Description:
All assets were created by me in Adobe Photoshop. I used Photoshop's pixel art tools to create them. 

Project Conclusions: 
- Game is published on itch.io but is for MacOS only. There was a bug with trying to download it on Windows that is still being worked on. 
- 41 hours spent on project including debugging
- ~492 lines of codes 
- 13 assets in total
  
This game is published on itch.io and currently is only available for MacOs.
