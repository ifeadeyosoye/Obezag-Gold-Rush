This game was created by Ifeoluwa Adeyosoye. 
This project was my highschool senior project. 

All assets in the game were drawn by me in Photoshop and all code was written by me. 
I used tutorials on Youtube to self-teach myself the Pygame library. 
Additionally I learned how to use Photoshop to create 2D assets. 

Obezag Gold Rush is an endless runner genre game where you play as an Obezag character while jumping over obstacles like volleyballs and dodging flying monsters to collect coins.  
This game was inspired by a school in Annapolis called Key School. 

This game is published on itch.io and currently is only available for MacOs.
